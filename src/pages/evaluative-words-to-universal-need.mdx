# Evaluative Words --> Unmet Universal Needs

This tool helps map evaluative words to describe emotions and then helps map them to the unmet universal need that I may be having.

## Expressing My Needs

> When `<observation>`, I feel `<evaluative word>` because I'm needing some `<universal need>`. Can you `<request>`?

## Guessing Other's Needs (Empathy)

> Are you feeling `<guess the feeling>` because you're needing some `<guess the need>`?
