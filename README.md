# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```console
npm i
```

## Local Development

```console
npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```console
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

```console
GIT_USER=robertjcolley npm run deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
